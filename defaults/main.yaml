### Device configuration

# The type of BIG-IQ node to setup.
#
# Valid values are,
#
#  * cm
#  * dcd
#
bigiq_onboard_node_type: cm

# The master passphrase to set on the device
#
# This passphrase is used as a seed to encrypt data that
# is stored in BIG-IQ. It must meet certain complexity
# requirements before BIG-IQ will accept it.
#
# These are,
#
#  * 16 characters long
#
# and must contain at least
#
#  * one uppercase
#  * one letter
#  * one lower case letter
#  * one number
#  * special character
#
# bigiq_onboard_master_passphrase: Change!Me!Now!1234

### DNS configuration
#
# DNS servers that the BIG-IQ will use for name resolution
#
# This value **must** be a list. By default, the nameserver
# provided is one run by Google. This will work, however,
# you will be unable to resolve DNS names internal to your
# organization.
#
# You should change this to the Primary/Secondary nameservers
# of your organization.
#
bigiq_onboard_dns_nameservers:
  - 8.8.8.8

# DNS search domains
#
# The domains that hostnames will be searched within by default.
#
# This should be changed to include the name of your organizations
# domain.
#
bigiq_onboard_dns_search:
  - localhost

### NTP configuration

# NTP servers to configure on the BIG-IQ
#
# This value **must** be a list of items (even if there is
# only one item).
#
# The default value is typically sufficient for most deployments
# unless you have a specific need in your environment (for
# instance if your stratum 1 time server is a site router or
# something.
#
bigiq_onboard_ntp_servers:
  - time.nist.gov

# The timezone to set on the BIG-IQ device
#
# This timezone should be specified in the "TZ" format as seen
# here
#
#  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
#
bigiq_onboard_timezone: America/Los_Angeles

### License configuration
#
# License key to use to license the BIG-IQ device.
#
# If you do not wish to license your device, leave this
# field empty.
#
bigiq_onboard_license_key:

### Hostname of the BIG-IQ
#
# Specifies the hostname that the BIG-IQ should have.
#
# By default, we do not specify this and let the system default
# to the hostname that is set when the device is first created.
#
# bigiq_onboard_hostname: foo.bar.com

### Force re-running the role
#
# This is useful in cases where you reset the BIG-IQs config via
# the ``clear-rest-storage -d`` command, but this command does
# not unset the config option that says the BIG-IQ is configured.
#
# Therefore, the BIG-IQ will say it is configured even after you
# essentially restored system defaults.
#
bigiq_onboard_force: false

### Discovery address Self-IP to set
#
# Use this to specify a self-ip to use as the discovery address.
# If this value is commented out (the default) it will use the
# BIG-IQ's management address as the discovery address.
#
# You **must** include the subnet with the IP address as well.
# The subnet should be in CIDR format. ex, 1.2.3.4/32
#
# A VLAN named 'internal' will be created along with the self-ip
# automatically.
#
# bigiq_onboard_discovery_address: 1.2.3.4/32

## Enable basic auth
#
# Enables basic authentication. This is useful only in debug
# or testing cases where you may be using something like Postman
# to test a BIG-IQ's REST API.
#
# This is disabled by default
#
bigiq_onboard_set_basic_auth: false
